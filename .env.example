# Example environment variables used by Kam
# Put any of these in a `.env` or export in your shell if you need to override defaults.
#
# Notes:
# - `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `KAM_PUBLISH_TOKEN` are used by `kam publish` when uploading to HTTP
#   endpoints. `--token` CLI option overrides these. For GitHub uploads the token typically
#   needs `repo` or `workflow` scopes depending on the target.
# - `KAM_LOCAL_REPO` is used by `kam sync` as a candidate local repository path to look for
#   pre-built module packages (useful in CI or when maintaining a local mirror).
# - `HOME` (Unix) / `USERPROFILE` (Windows) are read by the cache implementation to locate
#   the user's home directory; normally you should not set these unless you know what
#   you're doing.
# - The `KAM_*` variables below (for example `KAM_OLD_PATH`) are internal sh/powershell
#   environment variables emitted by `kam venv` activation scripts. They are listed here
#   for reference and typically should not be set manually.

# Authentication tokens (optional):
GITHUB_TOKEN=
# Fallback project-specific token used by `kam publish` when GITHUB_TOKEN is absent
KAM_PUBLISH_TOKEN=

# Local repository mirror path (optional). If set, `kam sync` will try this path first.
KAM_LOCAL_REPO=./repo

# Override the global cache root used by Kam. If unset, Kam uses:
#  - /data/adb/kam on Android
#  - %USERPROFILE%\.kam on Windows / ~/.kam on Unix-like systems
# You can set this to an absolute path, or a path relative to the current working directory.
# Example (PowerShell):
#   $Env:KAM_CACHE_ROOT = 'C:\\Users\\light\\kam_cache'
# Example (POSIX):
#   export KAM_CACHE_ROOT="$HOME/.kam"
KAM_CACHE_ROOT=

# System home dirs (shown for awareness; normally provided by OS):
# HOME=/home/youruser    # (Unix)
# USERPROFILE=C:\Users\youruser  # (Windows)

# Internal venv activation variables (examples - set by `kam venv` scripts):
# KAM_OLD_PATH - saved PATH before activation
# KAM_OLD_PS1  - saved PS1/prompt before activation
# KAM_VENV_ACTIVE - set to "1" while virtualenv active
KAM_OLD_PATH=
KAM_OLD_PS1=
KAM_VENV_ACTIVE=
