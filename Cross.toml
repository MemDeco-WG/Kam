# cross.toml - configuration for cross (https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)
#
# This file contains optional per-target configuration for cross. It is
# intentionally conservative: cross will use sensible defaults when entries
# are omitted. You can customize Docker images or environment variables per
# target here.

[build]
# Default target for local `cross build` when none is provided on the CLI.
target = "aarch64-linux-android"
